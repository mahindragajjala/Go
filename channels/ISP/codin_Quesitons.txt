Hereâ€™s a list of coding questions focused on applying the Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) in Goroutines, Worker Pools, and Channel Directionality in Go â€” ranging from basic to advanced:



 âœ… Beginner Level (Basic Channel Directionality)

1. Send-only Channel: Write a function that only sends integers (1 to N) to a channel.
2. Receive-only Channel: Write a function that receives data from a channel and prints it.
3. Bidirectional Channel: Pass a bidirectional channel to a function and use it to both send and receive.
4. Split Producer-Consumer: Create a simple program where one function sends data and another receives it, using directional channels.
5. Validate Direction: Modify a function signature to make sure it only sends or receives, and try to do the opposite â€” what happens?



 âœ… Intermediate Level (Worker Pool Design)

6. Basic Worker Pool: Create a worker pool that processes a list of integers (e.g., squares each number).
7. Enforce Roles with Direction: Implement a producer (`chan<-`), worker (`<-chan` and `chan<-`), and collector (`<-chan`) using channel directions.
8. Limit Worker Count: Make sure only N workers are running in parallel.
9. Use WaitGroup: Add a `sync.WaitGroup` to properly wait for all goroutines to finish.
10. Graceful Shutdown: Close channels safely when all jobs are done and all results are collected.



 âœ… Advanced Level (Complex Segregation and Use Cases)

11. Multiple Producers: Add more than one job producer to the pool â€” handle concurrent sends.
12. Multiple Collectors: Add multiple result collectors to a system and ensure no data is lost.
13. Fan-Out: One job source sends tasks to multiple workers â€” evenly distribute load.
14. Fan-In: Multiple workers send results into a single result channel.
15. Pipeline Pattern: Chain multiple worker stages (e.g., read â†’ process â†’ filter â†’ write) using one-way channels at each step.
16. Throttling Jobs: Use a time.Ticker to control how frequently workers pick up new jobs.
17. Timeout Using Context: Add `context.WithTimeout()` to cancel long-running jobs.
18. Interface Structuring: Use Go `interface{}` to define worker types and split behavior across structs.
19. Event-Based Pipeline: Design an event-driven system using directional channels (e.g., process order â†’ notify user).
20. Channel Wrappers: Wrap send-only or receive-only channels inside structs and expose only needed operations.



 âœ… Real-World Inspired Tasks

21. Image Processor: Simulate a job where each worker resizes an image file name and returns the resized version.
22. File Download Manager: Use multiple workers to download files concurrently and collect status reports.
23. Log Aggregator: Use directional channels to simulate log collection, filtering, and writing to disk.
24. API Crawler: Create a worker pool that makes API calls in parallel and collects responses.
25. Stock Market Listener: Use multiple goroutines to listen to different stock tickers and stream data through a collector.



 ðŸ§  Bonus: Design & Debug Challenges

26. Detect Data Race: Modify a poorly written worker pool that uses shared memory unsafely â€” fix it using channels and ISP.
27. Interface Abstraction: Define `JobSender`, `JobProcessor`, and `ResultConsumer` as interfaces and implement them with goroutines.
28. Logging Pipeline: Use a pipelined architecture to receive logs, enrich them, and output to file.
29. Backpressure Handling: Modify a pipeline to slow down producer if consumer is slow (hint: use buffered channels).
30. Unit Test Each Stage: Test producer, worker, and collector separately using mocks and directional channels.
