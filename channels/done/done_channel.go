/*
In Go, a done channel is a common pattern used to "signal cancellation or completion of goroutines".

It is typically a channel of type chan struct{} because we don‚Äôt need to send any data ‚Äî just a signal that something is ‚Äúdone‚Äù.
*/
/*
When and Why to Use a done Channel

To signal child goroutines to stop gracefully.
To notify a main/parent goroutine that a task has completed.
To avoid blocking forever and to clean up resources.
*/
/*
Basic Pattern
done := make(chan struct{})

You send the signal like:
close(done) // signal completion

You listen for it like:
<-done // block until done is closed

/*
üîÅ Call Flow Explanation
1. Main creates the done channel
done := make(chan struct{})

2. Main starts a child goroutine
go worker(done)

3. Child goroutine (worker) loops
It checks the done channel every loop cycle.
If done is not closed, it continues working.

select {
case <-done:
    return
default:
    // work
}
4. After 2 seconds, the main goroutine closes the done channel
close(done)

5. The worker goroutine receives from done and exits gracefully
case <-done:
    fmt.Println("Worker received stop signal")
    return

üß† Why Use close(done) Instead of done <- struct{}{}?

close(done) broadcasts to all receivers that the channel is closed.
No need to worry about multiple receivers.
Sending done <- struct{}{} works, but only one receiver gets the message.
