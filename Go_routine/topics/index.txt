Here's a detailed list of Golang goroutines-related topics, starting from basic to advanced, covering all related concurrency topics in Go:

1. Basic Golang Goroutines Topics
What is a goroutine?
How to create a simple goroutine (go func() { }())
Main goroutine vs child goroutines
Goroutine scheduling (brief overview)
Goroutine vs Thread (conceptual difference)
Anonymous functions as goroutines
Named functions as goroutines
Goroutines inside loops (common mistakes)

2. Goroutines with Channels (Medium Level)
Introduction to channels
Unbuffered channels
Buffered channels
Send and receive data from channels
Closing a channel and its importance
Range over a channel
select statement with channels
Timeouts with select and time.After
Directional channels (Send-only and Receive-only)
Nil channels and their behavior
Deadlocks and how to avoid them
polling


3. Synchronization Topics (Advanced Control)
Mutex (sync.Mutex) — protect shared resources
Read-Write Mutex (sync.RWMutex)
WaitGroups (sync.WaitGroup)
Once (sync.Once) — run code exactly once
Cond (sync.Cond) — conditional signaling between goroutines
Atomic operations (sync/atomic package)
Context (context package) for goroutine cancellation
Timers (time.Timer) and Tickers (time.Ticker)

4. Advanced Patterns and Architectures with Goroutines
Fan-Out, Fan-In pattern
Worker Pools pattern
Pipeline pattern
Semaphore pattern (limited concurrency control)
Bounded concurrency with buffered channels
Rate limiting with goroutines and channels
ErrGroup (golang.org/x/sync/errgroup) for managing goroutines with errors
Goroutine Leaks — causes and how to detect/prevent

5. Deeper Internal Topics (Pro Level)
How goroutines are scheduled internally (G-P-M model — Goroutine, Processor, Machine)
Work Stealing in Go runtime
Preemption in goroutine scheduling (Go 1.14+)
Stack growth and shrinkage in goroutines
Scheduler tracing and tuning (GODEBUG=schedtrace=1000)
Goroutine dump analysis (runtime.Stack or pprof)
Garbage Collection impact on goroutines
OS Thread Locking (runtime.LockOSThread)

6. Testing Goroutines
Race conditions and how to detect with -race flag
Testing concurrent code
Using context.Context in tests
Mocking timeouts and delays for goroutines
Benchmarking concurrent operations

7. Real-world use cases (Practical examples)
Building a Web Scraper using goroutines
Parallel API Calls
Background Workers in Web Servers
Cron Jobs using goroutines
Implementing Retry Mechanism
Building a simple Event-driven system
