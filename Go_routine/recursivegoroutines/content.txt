In Go, goroutines are "lightweight threads managed by the Go runtime", and recursion is when a function calls itself. 

When combined, a "recursive goroutine means a function launches a goroutine" and within that goroutine (or the function itself), it launches another goroutine recursively.

This can be "powerful but dangerous" if not managed carefully, as it can easily lead to too many goroutines, resource exhaustion, or unexpected behavior.
