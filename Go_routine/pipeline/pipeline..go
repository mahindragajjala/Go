SliceToChannel(nums)
go func() {
	for _, value := range nums {
		out <- value
	}
	close(out)
}()
This runs asynchronously because of go func().
BUT! The out <- value line is synchronous with the receiver:
It blocks (waits) until some other goroutine receives the value.
ðŸŸ¢ Verdict:
The goroutine is asynchronous (runs independently),
But each send out <- value is synchronized with the receiver (the Square stage).


Square(datachannel)
go func() {
	for n := range in {
		out <- n * n
	}
	close(out)
}()
Also runs asynchronously due to go func().
It blocks on range in (waits for values from SliceToChannel).
Then sends n * n to out, which also blocks until read by the final loop.
ðŸŸ¢ Verdict:
Again, asynchronous goroutine,
But synchronized with upstream and downstream via channels.
