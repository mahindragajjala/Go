/*
In Go, goroutines are used to run functions concurrently. However, you cannot directly return a value from a goroutine like this:

data := go functionname() // ‚ùå This is invalid

The above line will throw a syntax error because go starts a goroutine but "does not wait for it to return a value", and "it cannot assign a return value directly".

Correct Way to Get Output from a Goroutine
To receive data from a goroutine, "you need to use channels".
