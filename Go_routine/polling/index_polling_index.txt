1. What is Polling in Go?

   * Concept of actively checking for data/events vs passive waiting.

2. Polling with `select` and `default` (Non-blocking Channel Reads)

   * How to avoid blocking by using `select` with a `default` case.

3. Polling with `time.Ticker`

   * Periodically polling with a fixed interval using `time.Ticker`.

4. Polling with `time.Sleep`

   * Simple polling with delays using `time.Sleep` inside a loop.

5. Polling with Timeout using `time.After`

   * Stop polling after a fixed duration.



 ‚öôÔ∏è Intermediate Polling Concepts

6. Polling Multiple Channels using `select`

   * Monitor and read from multiple channels simultaneously.

7. Polling with Cancellation using `context.Context`

   * Gracefully stop polling using `context.WithCancel`, `WithTimeout`, etc.

8. Polling with Buffered Channels

   * Understand how buffered channels affect polling patterns.

9. Polling with Work Queues / Job Dispatching

   * Use polling to monitor and dispatch jobs from a task queue.

10. Polling and Deadlock Prevention

* Handle situations when channels have no senders or receivers.



 üöÄ Advanced and Real-World Polling Topics

11. Polling External Systems in a Goroutine (e.g., DB, API)

* Poll a database or HTTP endpoint every X seconds using Go routines.

12. Polling File/Directory Changes (simulated)

* Use goroutines and channels to watch for simulated file changes (or with third-party libraries like `fsnotify`).

13. Polling a Goroutine Health (Heartbeat Monitoring)

* A monitoring goroutine polls for heartbeat signals to detect failures.

14. Rate-limited Polling

* Use a ticker to prevent over-polling external services.

15. Polling with Retry Logic and Backoff Strategy

* Add retry intervals or exponential backoff when polling fails.

16. Polling over Networked Channels (via TCP, WebSocket)

* Poll data over network connections using channels as event pipelines.

17. Polling for Graceful Shutdown with Signals (e.g., `os.Signal`)

* Listen for termination signals and break polling loop gracefully.

18. Combining Polling with Event-Driven Approaches

* Mix polling and event notifications for hybrid systems.



 üß™ Testing Polling Logic

19. Unit Testing Polling Behavior

* Use mocked channels and timers to test polling loops.

20. Simulating Delayed Data for Polling Scenarios

* Introduce delays in goroutines to simulate realistic data polling.
