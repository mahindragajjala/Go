/*
A WaitGroup is used when you want to wait for a group of goroutines to finish before continuing with the rest of the program.
| Function    | Description                                        |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `wg.Add(n)` | Informs that there are `n` goroutines to wait for. |
| `wg.Done()` | Signals that one goroutine is finished.            |
| `wg.Wait()` | Blocks until the counter goes to 0.                |
