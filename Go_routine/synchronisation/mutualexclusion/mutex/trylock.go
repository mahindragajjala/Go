Printing Documents on a Shared Printer
Imagine:

There is one printer shared by several employees.
Employees want to print their documents.
If the printer is free, the employee uses it.
If the printer is busy, the employee does NOT wait but decides to try printing later or do something

*/

/*
In Go 1.18, the sync package introduced the TryLock() method for sync.Mutex, allowing you to attempt a lock without blocking.

This is useful when you want to try acquiring a lock only if itâ€™s immediately available, rather than waiting (blocking) until it becomes available.
