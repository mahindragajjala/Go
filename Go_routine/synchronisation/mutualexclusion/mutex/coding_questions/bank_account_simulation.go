//SOLUTION - 1
/*
you're launching both operations as separate goroutines at the same time.
Due to this, the order is non-deterministic â€” sometimes withdrawal happens first.

Use one WaitGroup for deposit, and another for withdraw

func Accounts() {
	var wgDeposit sync.WaitGroup
	var wgWithdraw sync.WaitGroup

	User1 := Account_details{
		Name:        "User1",
		TotalAmount: 1000,
	}

	wgDeposit.Add(1)
	go User1.Deposit(500, &wgDeposit)

	// Wait for deposit to finish before withdrawal
	wgDeposit.Wait()

	wgWithdraw.Add(1)
	go User1.Withdraw(1, &wgWithdraw)
	wgWithdraw.Wait()
}
*/

//SOLUTION - 2
/*
You can also use a channel to signal that deposit is done.

func Accounts() {
	done := make(chan bool)

	User1 := Account_details{
		Name:        "User1",
		TotalAmount: 1000,
	}

	go func() {
		var wg sync.WaitGroup
		wg.Add(1)
		User1.Deposit(500, &wg)
		wg.Wait()
		done <- true // signal deposit complete
	}()

	go func() {
		<-done // wait for deposit
		var wg sync.WaitGroup
		wg.Add(1)
		User1.Withdraw(1, &wg)
		wg.Wait()
	}()

	time.Sleep(1 * time.Second) // wait for goroutines to finish
}
