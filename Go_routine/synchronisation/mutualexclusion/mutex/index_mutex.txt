Sure! Here’s a comprehensive breakdown of different topics related to `mutex` in Go, followed by a list of coding questions suitable for programming practice and interviews.



 Topics on Mutex in Go

 1. Introduction to Mutex

	* What is a Mutex (Mutual Exclusion)?
	* Why do we need Mutex in concurrent programming?
	* Difference between Mutex and other synchronization primitives like channels.

 2. sync.Mutex Basics

* How to declare and use `sync.Mutex`.
* Locking and unlocking with `Lock()` and `Unlock()`.
* Basic example to protect shared resources.

 3. Mutex vs RWMutex

* Introduction to `sync.RWMutex`.
* Difference between `Mutex` and `RWMutex`.
* When to use `RWMutex` for better performance.

 4. Deadlocks and Mutex

* What is a deadlock?
* How can deadlocks occur with Mutex?
* Best practices to avoid deadlocks.

 5. Mutex and Goroutines

* Protecting data accessed by multiple goroutines.
* Using Mutex in real-world concurrent scenarios.

 6. Reentrancy and Mutex

* Is Go’s Mutex reentrant? (Answer: No)
* What happens if you lock a Mutex twice in the same goroutine?

 7. Performance Considerations

* Cost of locking and unlocking Mutex.
* Alternatives for high performance (e.g., atomic operations).

 8. TryLock and Mutex

* Go 1.18 introduced `TryLock()` for Mutex.
* How to use `TryLock` to attempt a non-blocking lock.

 9. Using Mutex in Structs

* Embedding `sync.Mutex` inside structs.
* Best practices to keep Mutex unexported.

 10. Race Detector and Mutex

* Using `go run -race` to detect race conditions.
* How Mutex helps to fix race conditions.

 11. Defer with Mutex Unlock

* Using `defer m.Unlock()` safely.
* Pros and cons of defer in locking.



 Coding Questions on Mutex (Programming & Interview Level)

 Basic Level

1. Protect a counter
   Implement a safe counter that multiple goroutines can increment concurrently using Mutex.

2. Bank account simulation
   Create a bank account struct with deposit and withdraw methods protected by a Mutex.

3. Race condition demonstration
   Write a program without Mutex causing a race, then fix it with Mutex.

4. Mutex in struct
   Create a struct with a Mutex embedded and demonstrate locking/unlocking.

 Intermediate Level

5. Read-Write locking
   Implement a cache with multiple readers and single writer using RWMutex.

6. TryLock usage
   Implement a scenario where you try to acquire a lock without blocking using `TryLock`.

7. Deadlock scenario
   Write code that causes a deadlock with Mutex and explain how to fix it.

8. Concurrent map with Mutex
   Implement a thread-safe map using a Mutex.

9. Defer unlock performance
   Compare unlocking a Mutex directly vs using `defer` inside a loop.

 Advanced Level

10. Mutex with condition variables
    Use `sync.Cond` with a Mutex to implement a producer-consumer problem.

11. Implement your own mutex
    Using atomic operations, implement a simplified mutex-like mechanism.

12. Timeout on locking
    Implement a function that tries to acquire a lock but times out after some duration if not acquired.

13. Mutex and Goroutine leak detection
    Write a program that uses Mutex and identify potential goroutine leaks if the Mutex is not unlocked properly.

14. Read-write mutex performance test
    Benchmark `sync.Mutex` vs `sync.RWMutex` for read-heavy workloads.
