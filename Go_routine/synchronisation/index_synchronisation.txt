Let's break this down into a comprehensive learning path for synchronization in Go, covering the following:

 üîê 1. What is Synchronization?

Synchronization ensures that multiple Goroutines can safely access shared resources without causing data races or inconsistencies. It controls the order of execution and access to shared memory.

Synchronization Topics (Advanced Control)
Mutex (sync.Mutex) ‚Äî protect shared resources
Read-Write Mutex (sync.RWMutex)
WaitGroups (sync.WaitGroup)
Once (sync.Once) ‚Äî run code exactly once
Cond (sync.Cond) ‚Äî conditional signaling between goroutines
Atomic operations (sync/atomic package)
Context (context package) for goroutine cancellation
Timers (time.Timer) and Tickers (time.Ticker)


 üß© 2. Types of Synchronization

| Type                    | Description                                                                                   |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Mutual Exclusion    | Ensures only one Goroutine accesses a resource at a time (e.g., `sync.Mutex`, `sync.RWMutex`) |
| Coordination        | Goroutines signal and wait for each other (e.g., `sync.WaitGroup`, `sync.Cond`)               |
| Atomic Operations   | Lock-free thread-safe operations for simple types (e.g., `sync/atomic`)                       |
| Channel-based       | Goroutines communicate and synchronize using channels                                         |
| Once-only Execution | Ensure a piece of code runs only once (e.g., `sync.Once`)                                     |

 üß∞ 3. Different Synchronization Operations

| Operation              | Tool/Technique              |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Lock/Unlock            | `sync.Mutex`                |
| Read/Write Lock        | `sync.RWMutex`              |
| Wait/Signal/Broadcast  | `sync.Cond`                 |
| Wait for Goroutines    | `sync.WaitGroup`            |
| Atomic Add/CompareSwap | `sync/atomic`               |
| Run Once               | `sync.Once`                 |
| Send/Receive           | Channels                    |
| Time-based Sync        | `time.Ticker`, `time.Timer` |

 ‚ôªÔ∏è 4. Synchronization Patterns

| Pattern Name                | Description                                     |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Producer-Consumer       | Goroutines producing and consuming via channels |
| Fan-In / Fan-Out        | Combine or distribute work via channels         |
| Worker Pool             | Fixed set of Goroutines processing tasks        |
| Barrier Synchronization | Wait until all Goroutines reach a certain point |
| Single Execution        | Run a task only once using `sync.Once`          |
| Pub-Sub                 | Using channels to broadcast messages            |
| Timeout / Deadline      | Using context or timers to sync with timeouts   |

Here are core topics and utilities for synchronization in Go:

1. `sync.Mutex`
2. `sync.RWMutex`
3. `sync.WaitGroup`
4. `sync.Once`
5. `sync.Cond`
6. `sync/atomic` operations
7. Channels (unbuffered & buffered)
8. Select statement for synchronization

 üß™ 6. Coding Questions (Basic to Advanced)

 üü¢ Basic Level

1. Create two Goroutines and use a `sync.Mutex` to protect a shared counter.
2. Demonstrate using a `sync.WaitGroup` to wait for multiple Goroutines to finish.
3. Write a program where `sync.Once` initializes a config only once.
4. Show an atomic counter increment using `sync/atomic`.
5. Use a channel to synchronize two Goroutines to alternate printing.

 üü° Intermediate Level

6. Implement a producer-consumer pattern using buffered channels.
7. Write a worker pool using channels and Goroutines.
8. Use `sync.RWMutex` to create a safe in-memory key-value store.
9. Demonstrate a Goroutine that listens to a `context.WithTimeout`.
10. Use `sync.Cond` to build a simple bounded buffer.

 üî¥ Advanced Level

11. Simulate a read-write load using multiple readers and writers with `RWMutex`.
12. Build a real-time ticker using `time.Ticker` to log timestamps every second.
13. Create a publish-subscribe model using channels and multiple listeners.
14. Write a Goroutine that performs a task but cancels if it takes too long (context with timeout).
15. Design a deadlock situation with two Goroutines and resolve it.
16. Create a throttling mechanism using `time.Ticker` to limit API calls.
17. Build a custom reusable barrier using `sync.Cond` to synchronize a group of workers.
18. Write an atomic counter that resets at a threshold using CAS loop.
19. Use `select` with multiple channels to simulate multiple task queues.
20. Implement a retry mechanism that uses backoff and context timeout.
