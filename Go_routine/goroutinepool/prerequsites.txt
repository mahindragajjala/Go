To perfectly learn and understand goroutine pools, it's important to first master goroutines and channels — since these are the building blocks of any worker pool in Go.

Here’s a structured list of prerequisites, including topics, operations, and patterns, with an easy-to-follow order.

✅ Prerequisites to Learn Before Goroutine Pool
🔹 1. Goroutines – Basics to Advanced
✅ Topics:
What is a goroutine?
How to launch a goroutine using go keyword
Main goroutine vs child goroutines
Concurrency vs Parallelism
When goroutines exit (lifecycle)

🔍 Operations:
Creating and starting goroutines
Synchronizing using time.Sleep (basic)
Passing parameters to goroutines
Capturing variables correctly in loops

🧠 Patterns:
Fire-and-forget
Recursive goroutines
Goroutines inside loops

📘 Example Questions:
Launch 5 goroutines that print "Hello" with their index.
Fix a bug where goroutines print the wrong index in a loop.

🔹 2. Channels – Basics to Deep Dive
✅ Topics:
What is a channel?
Buffered vs Unbuffered
Send/Receive operations
Closing channels
Nil channels and their behavior

🔍 Operations:

<- for send/receive
close(chan)
Using len() and cap() on buffered channels
Detecting closed channels with v, ok := <-ch

🧠 Patterns:
Ping-pong (goroutine communication)
Data pipelines
Fan-out / Fan-in

📘 Example Questions:
Send numbers 1-10 into a channel, read and print them.

Use a buffered channel of size 3 and analyze output order.

🔹 3. Channel Synchronization and Coordination
✅ Topics:
Blocking behavior of channels

One-to-one and many-to-one communication

Deadlocks and how to avoid them

Coordination with sync.WaitGroup

🔍 Operations:
Synchronize goroutines using channels

Use WaitGroup to wait for all goroutines to finish

🧠 Patterns:
One producer, multiple consumers

Barrier synchronization

📘 Example Questions:
Create 3 goroutines that all signal completion using a channel.

Wait for all goroutines using sync.WaitGroup.

🔹 4. Select Statement in Channels
✅ Topics:
select with multiple channels

Timeout with time.After

Non-blocking receive with default

Closing channels safely with select

🧠 Patterns:
Multiplexing

Timeout for jobs

Cancellation and control

📘 Example Questions:
Read from two channels using select and print whichever sends first.

Add a timeout for a long-running channel operation.

🔹 5. Context Package (for Cancellation)
✅ Topics:
context.Background(), WithCancel(), WithTimeout(), WithDeadline()

Propagating cancellation

Graceful shutdowns

📘 Example Questions:
Use context.WithTimeout to cancel a long-running goroutine.

Cancel all child goroutines when the parent function exits.

🔹 6. Error Handling in Goroutines
✅ Topics:
Returning errors from goroutines

Collecting errors via channels

Panic recovery in goroutines

📘 Example Questions:
Run 10 goroutines and return errors if any.

Recover from a panic inside a goroutine.

🔹 7. Concurrency Safety
✅ Topics:
Race conditions

sync.Mutex, sync.RWMutex

sync.Map, sync/atomic for atomic operations

📘 Example Questions:
Demonstrate a race condition and fix it using sync.Mutex.

Use sync/atomic to increment a counter from 100 goroutines.

✅ Summary Roadmap Before Goroutine Pool:
Priority	Topic	What to Master
🔥 High	Goroutines	Basics, lifecycle, parameter passing
🔥 High	Channels	Send/receive, buffered/unbuffered
✅ Mid	Select Statement	Multiplexing, timeout, non-blocking ops
✅ Mid	sync.WaitGroup	Synchronization
✅ Mid	Context	Timeouts, cancellation, graceful shutdown
🧠 Bonus	Error handling	Safe error communication
🧠 Bonus	Mutex/Atomic	Safe access to shared data
