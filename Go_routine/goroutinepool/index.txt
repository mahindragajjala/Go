âœ… Goroutine Pool: Topics + Coding Questions
1. Basic Concepts
What is a goroutine pool?

Why is it needed?

Difference between creating goroutines dynamically vs. using a pool.

ðŸ”¹ Coding Questions:
Create a program with 5 goroutines in a fixed pool to process 10 jobs.

Write a simple goroutine pool that reads integers from a slice and prints squares.

2. Worker Pool Architecture
Job queue (channel)

Worker goroutines

Result channel (optional)

WaitGroup to synchronize

ðŸ”¹ Coding Questions:
Build a worker pool that computes factorials for a list of numbers.

Modify the pool to return results in a result channel and collect them.

3. Fixed Pool Size vs Dynamic Pool Size
Fixed: Limited workers (common)

Dynamic: Increase/decrease based on load

ðŸ”¹ Coding Questions:
Implement a fixed-size pool with 3 workers and 20 jobs.

Create a dynamic pool that starts with 2 workers and grows to 5 under high load.

4. Job Structs and Interfaces
Custom job types using structs or interfaces

Make the pool generic

ðŸ”¹ Coding Questions:
Define a Job interface and use it with a worker pool to execute different types of tasks.

Build a pool that handles different job types: sending emails, resizing images, logging.

5. Graceful Shutdown of Pool
Stop workers safely when done

Close channels, use context

ðŸ”¹ Coding Questions:
Modify a goroutine pool to gracefully shut down once all jobs are processed.

Use context.Context to cancel all running workers after a timeout.

6. Timeouts and Cancellations
Use context.WithTimeout or context.WithCancel

Cancel long-running jobs

ðŸ”¹ Coding Questions:
Add a timeout to each job in the pool â€” skip jobs that take too long.

Cancel all workers if one job fails (simulate failure with a panic or error).

7. Handling Errors from Workers
Use a separate channel to collect errors

Return status of each job

ðŸ”¹ Coding Questions:
Implement error handling in a worker pool and collect all errors in a list.

Return a map of job ID to error (or nil) after processing.

8. Result Ordering
Preserve order of jobs in output even if processing is unordered

Use job IDs or indexes

ðŸ”¹ Coding Questions:
Write a pool that returns results in the same order as input.

Write a version that does not preserve order but is faster.

9. Throttling & Rate Limiting
Limit how many jobs are accepted per second

Use time.Ticker

ðŸ”¹ Coding Questions:
Add rate limiting to a goroutine pool (e.g., max 5 jobs/second).

Pause workers if queue size exceeds a threshold.

10. Real-world Applications
File processing

Network requests

Database operations

ðŸ”¹ Coding Questions:
Write a goroutine pool that downloads content from 10 URLs concurrently.

Process 100 files in parallel using a worker pool (count words in each).

Bonus: Advanced Patterns
Retry failed jobs

Job priorities

Back-pressure handling

Metrics (jobs/sec, errors)

ðŸ”¹ Coding Questions:
Retry failed jobs up to 3 times in the pool.

Implement priority jobs â€” high-priority jobs are processed first.
