Using `select` with `context.Context` (Cancellation)

* Graceful goroutine shutdown.
* Avoiding goroutine leaks.
* Listening for cancellation signals.
*/
/*
Using select with "context.Context" is a powerful idiom in Go for writing cancellation-aware goroutines

A cancellation-aware goroutine is a goroutine that:
Listens for a signal to stop (usually using context.Context) and exits gracefully when told to do so.
This is important because Go goroutines don't automatically stop â€” you must tell them when to stop

Think of a goroutine like a worker in a factory.
If you don't tell the worker to stop (even when the shift ends), they keep working forever. ðŸ˜“
A cancellation-aware worker checks a clock (like ctx.Done()) to know when the shift is over and then cleans up and leaves. âœ…

which helps with:
âœ… Graceful goroutine shutdown
âœ… Avoiding goroutine leaks
âœ… Listening for cancellation signals

/*
Package context defines the Context type, which carries deadlines, cancellation signals, and other request-scoped values across API boundaries and between processes.

Context provides a mechanism to control the lifecycle, cancellation, and propagation of requests across multiple goroutines.

Consider a scenario where you need to fetch data from multiple APIs concurrently. By using context, you can ensure that all the API requests are canceled if any of them exceeds a specified timeout.
