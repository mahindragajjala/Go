 🔹 1. Introduction to `select`
* What is `select`?
* Syntax and basic structure.
* Difference between `select` and `switch`.

 🔹 2. Using `select` with Multiple Channels
* Listening on multiple channels simultaneously.
* Choosing the first channel that is ready.
* Random selection if multiple channels are ready at the same time.

 🔹 3. `select` with Send and Receive Operations
* Receiving from multiple channels.
* Sending to multiple channels.
* Combining send/receive in one `select`.

 🔹 4. Using `select` with `default` Case
* Non-blocking communication.
* Polling multiple channels.
* When to use and when to avoid `default`.

 🔹 5. Using `select` with `time.After` (Timeouts)
* Implementing timeouts on channel operations.
* Preventing goroutines from waiting forever.


select {
case msg := <-ch:
    fmt.Println("Received:", msg)
case <-time.After(2 * time.Second):
    fmt.Println("Timeout!")
}

 🔹 6. Using `select` with `context.Context` (Cancellation)

* Graceful goroutine shutdown.
* Avoiding goroutine leaks.
* Listening for cancellation signals.

 🔹 7. Deadlocks and Starvation in `select`

* Common mistakes and how to avoid them.
* What happens when no case is ready and no default is present?
* Preventing goroutines from being blocked forever.



 🔹 8. Handling Closed Channels in `select`

* Behavior of `select` when receiving from a closed channel.
* Detecting closed channels using the comma-ok idiom.



 🔹 9. Infinite `select` Loop Patterns

* Fan-in pattern: Merge multiple channels into one.
* Fan-out pattern: Distribute work across multiple workers.
* Event loop or reactor pattern using `select`.



 🔹 10. Building Concurrency Patterns with `select`

* Worker pool pattern.
* Publish-subscribe system.
* Multiplexing input from multiple sources.
* Throttling and rate limiting.



 🔹 11. `select` with Buffered vs Unbuffered Channels

* How `select` behavior changes based on buffering.
* Combining buffered channels and timeouts.



 🔹 12. Nesting `select` and Combining with Loops

* `for { select { ... } }` idioms.
* Nested `select` inside function calls or handlers.



 🔹 13. select{} Blocking Forever

* Empty `select{}` as a permanent block.
* Use in tests or for demonstration.



 🛠️ Real-Time Examples to Practice

* Implement a goroutine watcher with timeout.
* Build a web scraper with fan-out/fan-in pattern.
* Use `select` for debounce/throttle events.
* Create a cancellation-aware worker.
