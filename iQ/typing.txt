 Feature              Description 

 Compiled             Converts code into a single binary executable.                       
 Statically Typed     Type checking is done at compile time.                               
 Garbage Collected    Automatically manages memory.                                        
 Concurrency Support  Built-in concurrency model using goroutines and channels.            
 Fast Compilation     Very fast build times compared to other compiled languages.          
 Cross-Platform       Can build binaries for Windows, Linux, macOS, etc.                   
 Simple Syntax        Clean and minimalistic, inspired by C, but easier to read and write. 

Go (also known as Golang) is an "open-source", "statically typed", "compiled programming language" designed for "simplicity", 
"high performance", and ease of use, especially for "system-level" and "server-side development".

Who Created Go?
Go was created at Google in 2007 by:
Robert Griesemer
Rob Pike
Ken Thompson (one of the original creators of Unix)
It was publicly announced in November 2009 as an open-source project.

Why Go Was Created
The creators were frustrated with:
"Long build times" in large C++ projects.
Complexity of modern C++.
Lack of good "concurrency support".
Go was designed to:
Improve "developer productivity".
Make concurrent programming easier.
Be efficient for "cloud infrastructure" and "networking tools".

Where is Go Used?
Cloud-native development (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes are written in Go)
Web backends and APIs (via frameworks like Gin, Echo)
Networking tools
CLI tools
Distributed systems
