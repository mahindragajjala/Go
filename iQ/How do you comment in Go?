//How do you comment in Go?


In Go (Golang), you can write comments to describe your code for better readability and maintainability. Comments are ignored by the compiler and do not affect program execution.

âœ… 1. Types of Comments in Go
ðŸ”¹ A. Singleline Comment
						Starts with //
									Used for short explanations or notes
									// This is a singleline comment
									fmt.Println("Hello, Go!")
ðŸ”¹ B. Multiline Comment (Block Comment)
						Starts with /* and ends with */
						Can span multiple lines

						/*
						This is a multiline comment.
						It can be used to explain complex logic
						or temporarily disable blocks of code.
						*/
						fmt.Println("Welcome!")

ðŸŸ© Documentation Comments (Recommended for Exported Code)
						Begin with the name of the identifier (function, type, etc.)
						Used by Go tools like godoc
						// Add adds two integers and returns the result.
						func Add(a int, b int) int {
							return a + b
						}
ðŸ”¸ Good practice: Always use complete sentences for documentation of exported functions/types
