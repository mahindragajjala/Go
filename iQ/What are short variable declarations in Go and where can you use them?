What are short variable declarations in Go and where can you use them?

In Go, short variable declaration is a convenient way to declare and initialize variables 
in one step using the := syntax.



 Rule                                        Explanation                                                                

 Must be used inside a function          Can't be used at the package level (i.e., outside of functions).           
 Type is inferred automatically          Based on the value on the right-hand side.                                 
 Can declare multiple variables at once  Like: `a, b := 10, "hello"`                                                
 At least one variable must be new       You can reuse existing variables, but at least one must be newly declared.
