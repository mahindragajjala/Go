1. Find Pair with Target Sum in Sorted Array
   *Given a sorted array, return true if there exists a pair that sums up to a target value.*

2. Reverse an Array In-Place
   *Reverse the elements of an array without using extra space.*

3. Check if String is Palindrome
   *Use two pointers to check if a string reads the same forwards and backwards.*

4. Remove Duplicates from a Sorted Array
   *Given a sorted array, remove duplicates in-place and return the new length.*

5. Merge Two Sorted Arrays into One
   *Given two sorted arrays, merge them into one sorted array using TPT.*

These involve a bit more logic or deal with triplets, windows, and conditions.

6. Move Zeroes to End
   *Move all 0s to the end of an array while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.*

7. Sort Array of 0s, 1s, and 2s (Dutch National Flag Problem)
   *Use three pointers to sort the array.*

8. Triplet Sum in Sorted Array
   *Check if a triplet exists such that their sum equals the target.*

9. Subarray with Given Sum (Positive Integers Only)
   *Use sliding two-pointer technique to find a subarray that adds up to a target.*

10. Find the Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
    *Use the sliding window technique with two pointers.*

11. Is Subsequence
    *Check if one string is a subsequence of another using two pointers.*

These challenge your understanding and require combining TPT with other logic.

12. Container With Most Water
    *Find the maximum area between vertical lines on an array.*

13. Trapping Rain Water
    *Compute the total water that can be trapped between elevations.*

14. 4Sum Problem
    *Find all unique quadruplets that sum to a target using nested two pointers.*

15. Minimum Window Substring (Sliding Window + Hashing)
    *Find the smallest substring that contains all characters of another string.*

16. Minimum Operations to Make Array Palindrome
    *Convert array to palindrome using minimum merge operations.*

17. Compare Strings Represented by Arrays
    *Compare two arrays of characters using two pointers to simulate string comparison.*

18. Minimum Number of Swaps to Bring Elements Less Than K Together
    *Optimize groupings of elements less than a value using TPT.*

19. Remove N Characters to Make Two Strings Equal
    *Use TPT to align and compare from both ends.*

20. Maximize Number of Non-Overlapping Subarrays With Target Sum
    *Harder variant of subarray sum using advanced pointer resetting.*

1. Do 1–5 to build basics (one sitting).
2. Move to 6–11 to see real-world logic usage.
3. Practice 12–20 slowly, with debugging and dry-runs.
