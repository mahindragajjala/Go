In Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), various problem-solving techniques help simplify and optimize the solution. Here are popular and essential techniques (like the Two Pointer Technique) that every DSA learner should know:



 üîÅ 1. Two Pointer Technique

* Use Case: Arrays, strings, linked lists
* Idea: Use two pointers to traverse from start and end or move conditionally.
* Examples:

  * Check if an array has a pair with a given sum (sorted array).
  * Reverse an array in-place.
  * Move zeroes to the end of the array.



 üîÑ 2. Sliding Window Technique

* Use Case: Arrays, strings
* Idea: Use a window (subarray) that moves forward to track a subset.
* Examples:

  * Maximum sum subarray of size `k`.
  * Longest substring without repeating characters.
  * Minimum window substring.



 üîç 3. Binary Search Technique

* Use Case: Sorted arrays, search problems
* Idea: Divide and conquer approach to reduce search space by half.
* Examples:

  * Find element in a sorted array.
  * Search in rotated sorted array.
  * Find square root of a number.



 üßÆ 4. Prefix Sum / Difference Array

* Use Case: Cumulative sum, range queries
* Idea: Preprocess array to answer range sum queries quickly.
* Examples:

  * Sum of elements in a subarray.
  * Number of occurrences in range.
  * Range update queries.



 üîÅ 5. Fast & Slow Pointers (Floyd's Cycle)

* Use Case: Linked Lists, cycle detection
* Idea: Two pointers moving at different speeds to detect loops.
* Examples:

  * Detect cycle in a linked list.
  * Find the starting point of a loop.
  * Find middle of a linked list.



 üîÅ 6. Recursion & Backtracking

* Use Case: Decision problems, permutations, path finding
* Idea: Try all possibilities, undo changes (backtrack) when needed.
* Examples:

  * N-Queens Problem
  * Sudoku Solver
  * Subset/Permutation generation



 üéØ 7. Greedy Technique

* Use Case: Optimization problems
* Idea: Take the best choice at each step without reconsidering.
* Examples:

  * Activity Selection
  * Fractional Knapsack
  * Huffman Coding



 üìê 8. Divide and Conquer

* Use Case: Recursive problems
* Idea: Break problem into subproblems, solve recursively, combine.
* Examples:

  * Merge Sort
  * Quick Sort
  * Binary Search



 üìä 9. Dynamic Programming (DP)

* Use Case: Overlapping subproblems, optimization
* Idea: Store results of subproblems to avoid recomputation.
* Examples:

  * Fibonacci
  * 0/1 Knapsack
  * Longest Common Subsequence



 üß± 10. Bit Manipulation

* Use Case: Optimization, low-level operations
* Idea: Use bitwise operators for efficient calculations.
* Examples:

  * Check if number is power of two
  * Count set bits
  * Swap two numbers without temp variable



 üå≤ 11. Union Find / Disjoint Set

* Use Case: Graphs (connectivity), clustering
* Idea: Track disjoint sets with union and find operations.
* Examples:

  * Detect cycle in an undirected graph
  * Kruskal‚Äôs Algorithm (MST)
  * Connected components



 ‚õì 12. Topological Sorting (DFS / BFS)

* Use Case: Graphs with dependencies (DAG)
* Idea: Linear ordering of vertices where `u -> v`, `u` appears before `v`.
* Examples:

  * Course schedule
  * Task scheduling with dependencies



 üîÅ 13. Monotonic Stack / Queue

* Use Case: Range queries, Next Greater Element
* Idea: Stack/Queue that keeps elements in increasing/decreasing order.
* Examples:

  * Largest Rectangle in Histogram
  * Next Greater Element
  * Sliding Window Maximum
