package traversal

/*
 ðŸ”¹Basic Level
1.Printing All Elements
   * Iterate and print each element.
2.Finding Maximum / Minimum Element
   * Track and update while traversing.
3.Sum / Average of Elements

4.Counting Specific Elements

   * e.g., count even/odd/zeros/positives/negatives.

5.Linear Search

   * Search for an element in the array.

6.Reversing the Array (using one loop)

7.Copying One Array to Another

---

 ðŸ”¹Intermediate Level

8.Prefix Sum Array

   * Cumulative sum array used for range queries.

9.Sliding Window Traversal

   * Fixed-size or variable-size window patterns.

10.Rotating an Array (Left/Right)

* One position, k positions.

11.Finding All Pairs with Given Sum

12.Finding Duplicates in Array
