An array is a collection of elements of the same data type, stored in contiguous memory locations. 
It allows storing multiple values under a "single variable name", and each element is accessed using an "index".

Basic Characteristics of Arrays:

Fixed Size: Once declared, the size of an array cannot be changed.
Same Data Type: All elements must be of the same type (e.g., all integers or all floats).
Indexing: Elements are accessed using indices starting from 0 (in most programming languages).
Contiguous Memory: Elements are stored next to each other in memory.
