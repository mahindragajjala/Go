package dtypes

/*
✅ 1. Polymorphism
→ To write flexible code that works with different types.

✅ 2. Dependency Injection
→ Pass interfaces instead of concrete types, to make code more testable and modular.

✅ 3. Mocking in Unit Testing
→ Replace real objects with mocks/fakes using interfaces.

✅ 4. Plug & Play Design
→ Allow swapping implementations without changing code.

✅ 5. Writing Libraries/Packages
→ Expose interfaces instead of concrete types for user flexibility.

✅ 6. Implementing Strategy Patterns
→ Allow dynamic behavior changes at runtime.

✅ 7. Working with Standard Library
→ Like io.Reader, io.Writer, http.Handler are all interfaces.

✅ 8. Multiple Implementations for a Single Behavior
→ One interface, many concrete types.

✅ 9. Middleware in Web Frameworks (like Gin, Echo)
→ Pass handlers using interfaces.

✅ 10. Decoupling Code Layers
→ Separate business logic from storage, APIs, etc.
