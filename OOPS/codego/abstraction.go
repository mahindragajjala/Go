Abstraction means showing only the essential details and hiding the complex background logic.

You interact with what matters, not how it works behind the scenes.

ðŸ§º 2. Real-Life Example of Abstraction
ðŸ“± Example: Mobile Phone

When you use a phone:
You tap icons to call, message, or open apps.
You donâ€™t worry about how internally the screen detects your touch, or how the call is connected.

ðŸ“Œ You see what you need and the rest is hidden = Abstraction

/*
Consider a real-life example of a man driving a car. The man only knows that pressing the accelerator will increase the speed of the car or applying brakes will stop the car but he does not know how on pressing the accelerator the speed is actually increasing, he does not know about the inner mechanism of the car or the implementation of the accelerator, brakes, etc in the car. This is what abstraction is.
