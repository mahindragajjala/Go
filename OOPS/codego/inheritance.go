/*
Inheritance is when one class (child) gets the properties and behavior of another class (parent), so we can reuse code and extend functionality.
*/
/*
Real-Time Example of Inheritance
ðŸ“¦ Example: Appliance â†’ Washing Machine
Parent class: Appliance (has power ON/OFF)
Child class: WashingMachine (inherits power ON/OFF and adds Wash, Rinse, Spin)

"This way:
You donâ€™t re-write the power functions.
You reuse and extend features in the child".
*/
/*
Go does not support inheritance in the traditional Java-style way (no extends keyword).
Instead, "Go uses "COMPOSITION" (a more flexible and preferred way in Go)."
