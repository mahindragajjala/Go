 🧠 Abstraction in Programming – Explained Simply



 ✅ 1. What is Abstraction? (Simple Definition)

> Abstraction means showing only the essential details and hiding the complex background logic.

You interact with what matters, not how it works behind the scenes.



 🧺 2. Real-Life Example of Abstraction

# 📱 Example: Mobile Phone

* When you use a phone:

  * You tap icons to call, message, or open apps.
  * You don’t worry about how internally the screen detects your touch, or how the call is connected.

> 📌 You see what you need and the rest is hidden = Abstraction



 ☕ 3. Abstraction in Java

Java supports abstraction using:

* Abstract Classes
* Interfaces



# ✅ Example: Using an Abstract Class

java
abstract class Vehicle {
    abstract void start(); // abstract method (no body)
    
    void fuel() {
        System.out.println("Petrol or Diesel");
    }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
    void start() {
        System.out.println("Car starts with key");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Vehicle v = new Car();
        v.start(); // Car-specific implementation
        v.fuel();  // Shared method
    }
}


🟢 Output:


Car starts with key
Petrol or Diesel


> ✅ Only the necessary behavior is exposed (`start()`, `fuel()`), the inner engine mechanism is hidden.



 🦫 4. Abstraction in Go (Golang)

Go uses interfaces to achieve abstraction.

You define what should be done, not how it’s done — the implementation is hidden behind the interface.



# ✅ Go Example:

go
package main

import "fmt"

// Interface (abstract definition)
type Vehicle interface {
    Start()
}

// Struct implementing the interface
type Car struct{}

func (c Car) Start() {
    fmt.Println("Car starts with key")
}

func main() {
    var v Vehicle = Car{}
    v.Start() // Abstract call through interface
}


🟢 Output:


Car starts with key


> ✅ The user knows what to do (`Start()`), not how it’s done.



 🔍 Java vs Go – Abstraction Comparison

| Feature              | Java                                | Go (Golang)                     |
| -- | -- | - |
| Supports abstraction | Via `abstract` classes & interfaces | Via `interface` only            |
| Implementation hides | Behind abstract methods             | Behind interface implementation |
| Abstract keyword     | Yes                                 | No (uses interface)             |
| Multiple abstraction | Via interfaces                      | Via multiple interfaces         |



 📌 Summary

* Abstraction = Focus on what an object does, not how it does it.
* In Java, achieved using abstract classes and interfaces.
* In Go, achieved using interfaces only.
