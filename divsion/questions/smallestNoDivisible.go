Find Next Multiple
Given a number n and a multiple k, find the smallest number greater than or equal to n that is divisible by k.

You are given:
A number n
A number k (which is the multiple youâ€™re interested in)

You need to find:
The smallest number that is greater than or equal to n and divisible by k.
