Array types
An array is a numbered sequence of elements of a single type, called the element type.
The number of elements is called the length of the array and is never negative.

ArrayType   = "[" ArrayLength "]" ElementType . ---------> var a [5]int    // array of 5 integers
ArrayLength = Expression . ---------> var a [5]int    // array of 5 integers
ElementType = Type . ---------> //int/string/...etc

The length is part of the "array's type"; it must evaluate to a non-negative
constant representable by a value of type int.

The length of array a can be
discovered using the built-in function "len".

The elements can be addressed by
integer indices 0 through len(a)-1.

Array types are always one-dimensional
but may be composed to form multi-dimensional types.

[32]byte
[2*N] struct { x, y int32 }
[1000]*float64
[3][5]int
[2][2][2]float64  // same as [2]([2]([2]float64))

An array type T may not have an element of type T, or of a type containing T as a component,
directly or indirectly, if those containing types are only array or struct types.
// invalid array types
type (
	T1 [10]T1                 // element type of T1 is T1
	T2 [10]struct{ f T2 }     // T2 contains T2 as component of a struct
	T3 [10]T4                 // T3 contains T3 as component of a struct in T4
	T4 struct{ f T3 }         // T4 contains T4 as component of array T3 in a struct
)

// valid array types
type (
	T5 [10]*T5                // T5 contains T5 as component of a pointer
	T6 [10]func() T6          // T6 contains T6 as component of a function type
	T7 [10]struct{ f []T7 }   // T7 contains T7 as component of a slice in a struct
)
