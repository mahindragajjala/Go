WHAT IS RESTAPI IN PROGRAMMING ?
REST API stands for "Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface". 

It is a "web service architecture" style that allows clients (like mobile apps, frontend apps, or other services) to communicate with servers over HTTP/HTTPS.

üîπ In simple terms: A REST API allows different software systems to talk to each other over the internet using standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.






WHAT IS A RESTFUL API 
A RESTful API is an implementation of REST principles. 
It follows rules (REST constraints) to make the web communication:
Stateless
Cacheable
Uniform
Client-Server based
Uses URIs to identify resources
Uses HTTP methods for operations
                      
                      üí° What is REST API?
REST API (Representational State Transfer API) is a style of web architecture that allows systems to communicate over HTTP using standard methods like:
GET ‚Üí Fetch data
POST ‚Üí Create data
PUT ‚Üí Update data
DELETE ‚Üí Delete data
It follows principles of REST but not necessarily all of them strictly.
                      
                      üí° What is RESTful API?
A RESTful API is a strict implementation of REST principles.
It means the API:

‚úÖ Is stateless
‚úÖ Uses standard HTTP methods
‚úÖ Exposes resources via URIs (/users/1)
‚úÖ Returns standard HTTP status codes
‚úÖ Supports caching
‚úÖ Has client-server separation
‚úÖ Often returns JSON or XML


EXAMPLES OF THE RESTAPI AND RESTFUL API :
                          ‚úÖ REST API Example (Not RESTful)
An API that is just sending data over HTTP but not fully following REST rules:
                GET /getEmployeeDetails?id=1
                Uses verbs (getEmployeeDetails) in the URL
                May store session info (not stateless)
                Doesn't fully follow REST constraints

                          ‚úÖ RESTful API Example
An API that follows REST architectural principles strictly:
                GET /employees/1
                /employees is a resource
                1 is the ID of the employee
                Uses GET method properly
                Server is stateless ‚Äì no session stored

                          Simple Analogy
REST API:
‚ÄúA person who loosely follows traffic rules but still reaches the destination.‚Äù

RESTful API:
‚ÄúA person who strictly follows every traffic rule while driving.‚Äù
Both are going somewhere using roads (HTTP), but RESTful is disciplined and standard-compliant.

                            üå± Basics
What is REST and RESTful API?
HTTP Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH
Status Codes (200 OK, 404 Not Found, 500 Server Error)
Resource vs Endpoint
